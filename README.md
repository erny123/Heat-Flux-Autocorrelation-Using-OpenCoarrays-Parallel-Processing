# Heat-Flux-Autocorrelation-Using-OpenCoarrays-Parallel-Processing
 Fortran-90 program using Open Coarrays for parallel processing of the Heat Flux Autocorrelation Function

This code is an addition to the [Green Kubo Method for Calculating Thermal Conductivity](https://github.com/erny123/MD-GreenKubo-Thermal-Conductivity)

The Green Kubo fluctuation dissipation method for calculating thermal conductivity requires long correlation times depending on the thermal conductivity of the material (for materials with large thermal conductivity like Diamond, extremely long correlation times are needed (10 ns or more))
